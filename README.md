# ZeekDockerFiles
Those files were created as a part of my internship at Bibliotheca Alexandrina as a Security Engineer.

We used Zeek an intrusion detection system to detect and analyze packets coming in and out of our network, furthermore We included Zeek Intelligence and Clustering
Frameworks to enhance our IDS, for demonstration and automation We used Docker to simulate this process resulting in log files which We used Brim to visualize.
